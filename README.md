# Twooter

A super basic Social Media application.

Currently, the UI is lacking, but the basic functionality is there:

* Account Creation + Signout
* A Feed of recent "twoots"
  * Currently shows ALL twoots, there are no "follow" features
* The ability to send "twoots", which then appear in the Feed

This application is written using Flutter and Firebase for cloud storage, for purely educational purposes.

# Hopefully At Some Point (TODO)
* Follows
* Slightly nicer UI
